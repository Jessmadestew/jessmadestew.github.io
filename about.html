  <h2>Bio</h2>
  <p> Growing up with an overactive imagination and a tendency to daydream, I’ve always expressed myself through creative modes, such as drawing or writing. I believe that, in numerous pieces, I’ve taken some sort of inspiration from my dreams and nightmares alike. This usually produces a unique, if not sometimes eerie, creation. Building upon the memories of passages I've read and scenes I've seen, I've created hundreds of stories that will most likely never possess a physical form. </p>
  <p>I admire the works of <a href="http://www.markryden.com/index.html" target="blank">Mark Ryden</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TimBurton/" target="blank">Tim Burton</a>, and <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/" target="blank">Neil Gaiman</a>.

  <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>  
    <p>Ultimately, I’m set on learning skills, gaining experience, and meeting people. It’s an added bonus if I make someone else’s day a tad bit better.
    </p>
  <h2>SKILLS & ABILITIES</h2>  
    <p>I can easily add up, or subtract away from, sums mentally. I’m also quick to learn new skills and even quicker to adopt them.  I’m very organized, which my workspace typically reflects well.
